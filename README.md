# GEODIST-PyTorch
PyTorch version for GEODIST: the computational approach for tracking and detecting statistically significant linguistic shifts of words across geographical regions

- Freshman or Fresher? Quantifying the Geographic Variation of Language in Online Social Media: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06786.pdf
- Code for learning geographically-informed word embeddings: https://github.com/dbamman/geoSGLM


### DONE
- Baseline Models
  - Frequencies Model
  - Syntactic Model
- GEODIST Model (`train`/`vector`(get embeddings for a word)/`neighbors`)

### TODO
- `ScoreSignificance` method
